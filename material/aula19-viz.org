* Presenting Performance Results

- Goal: communicate analysis results clearly for effective decision-making  
- An unclear analysis is as useless as none \to clarity is the analyst’s duty  
- Use words, pictures, and graphs wisely to simplify complex data  

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Why use graphical charts
- ``A picture is worth a thousand words'' \to saves time and clarifies results  
- Engages readers and highlights key insights quickly  
- Summarizes, emphasizes, and reinforces conclusions

* Types of Variables and Chart Selection

The choice of a graphic chart depends on the *type of variable* displayed  

#+latex: \vfill

Qualitative (Categorical) Variables
- Defined by mutually exclusive subclasses (states or levels)
- Can be:
  - Ordered: e.g., Supercomputers → Minicomputers → Microcomputers  
  - Unordered: e.g., Workload type = Scientific, Engineering, Educational  

Quantitative Variables
- Expressed numerically  
- Two types:
  - Discrete: Countable values (e.g., number of processors, disk blocks)  
  - Continuous: Uncountably infinite values (e.g., response time, weight)  

#+latex: \pause\vfill

Choosing the right chart
- Line chart: relationship between two continuous variables  
- Bar/Column chart: when the independent variable is discrete or
  qualitative

* Guidelines for Effective Graphic Charts 1/2
Require Minimum Effort from the Reader
- The best chart is the one that’s easiest to read and understand
- Prefer direct labeling over legend boxes — reduces reader effort
- Directly label columns or curves rather than using a separate legend

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Maximize Information
- Make each graph self-explanatory.
- Prefer words over symbols \to less cognitive load
- Include full, informative axis labels and units  @@latex:\linebreak@@
  (e.g., “CPU time in seconds” instead of “CPU time”)
- Provide enough context to enable understanding without reading extra text

#+attr_latex: :width .6\linewidth
[[./img/direct-labels.png]]

* Guidelines for Effective Graphic Charts 2/2

Minimize Ink
- Strive for a high information-to-ink ratio
- Avoid clutter \to unnecessary grid lines, labels, or information
- Prefer charts that add _meaning_, not decoration

#+attr_latex: :width .6\linewidth
[[./img/minimize-ink.png]]

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Use Commonly Accepted Conventions
- Origin at (0,0) unless there’s a reason not to
- Independent variable → x-axis; dependent → y-axis
- Linear, evenly spaced scales increasing left-to-right and bottom-to-top.

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Avoid Ambiguity
- Always show axes, scale divisions, and origin
- Clearly identify each curve or bar
- Avoid mixing unrelated variables in the same chart

* Common Charting Mistakes 1/3

Too Many Alternatives
- Readers can only grasp 5--7 messages at once
- Keep it simple:  
  - Line chart → max of 6 curves  
  - Bar/column chart → max of 10 bars  
  - +Pie chart → ≤ 8 slices+ (strikethrough by myself, never use pie charts)
  - Histogram → at least 5 data points per bucket

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Too Many Y-Variables
- Avoid plotting several y-axes
- Makes interpretation difficult \to use separate charts for clarity
- Saving space should never come at the cost of readability

#+attr_latex: :width .6\linewidth
[[./img/too-many-ys.png]]

* Common Charting Mistakes 2/3

Using Symbols Instead of Text
- Readers should never have to look up what a symbol means
- Use keywords directly on the chart instead of cryptic symbols
- The goal is instant recognition \to not visual minimalism

#+attr_latex: :width .6\linewidth
[[./img/code-text.png]]

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Extraneous Information
- Each chart should convey one clear message
- Remove unnecessary grid lines, decorations, or redundant labels
- Match grid granularity to the precision needed
  
* Common Charting Mistakes 3/3

Improper Scale Ranges
- Automatic scaling can mislead \to adjust ranges manually when needed
- Avoid showing empty or irrelevant regions of data
- Choose scales that highlight trends, not distort them

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Wrong Chart Type
- Line charts imply interpolated values \to use only for continuous variables
- Bar or pie charts are better for categorical comparisons (e.g., CPU types)
- Misusing chart types confuses interpretation and weakens the message.

* Pictorial games /aka/ Deceptive use of graphics 1/4

#+begin_center
``A picture is worth a thousand words'' and can deceive just as much
#+end_center

Unlike honest mistakes, pictorial games are intentional manipulations to mislead
- Common in advertising and trade press, less so in technical literature
- Purpose: exaggerate differences or distort reality through visual tricks
  
# Examples: 1/ Distorted scales and baselines; 2/ 3D effects hiding
# proportions; 3/ Selective truncation of data; 4/ PInconsistent visual
# encodings.

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Using Nonzero Origins to Emphasize the Difference
- (a) MINE is much much better than YOURS and
- (b) MINE and YOURS are almost the same.

* Pictorial games /aka/ Deceptive use of graphics 2/4

The ``Double-Whammy'' Graph, Dramatizing Performance Trends
- Plotting two metrics on the same chart doubles the emotional impact
- Example: Throughput vs. Response Time  
  - As response time increases, throughput decreases
  - Both convey the same information
    - /but shown together, they appear twice as bad/
- Used deliberately to amplify the perceived decline or problem

#+attr_latex: :width .5\linewidth
[[./img/double-whammy.png]]

*Lesson:* Always question whether multiple metrics in a chart are
*independent* or just *mirror images* of each other \to or simply avoid multiple metrics

* Pictorial games /aka/ Deceptive use of graphics 3/4

Performance metrics are often random variables
- Results vary across runs

#+latex: \pause\vfill
  
Plotting Random Quantities without Showing Confidence Intervals
- Reporting only the mean hides uncertainty
  - Always show confidence intervals to express statistical variation
- Overlapping intervals ⇒ systems are statistically indistinguishable
- Without them, charts can mislead (superiority may be insignificant)

#+attr_latex: :width .6\linewidth
[[./img/confidence.png]]

* Pictorial games /aka/ Deceptive use of graphics 4/4

Histogram cell size: choosing bucket widths alters apparent distribution
- Too large → hides variation; too small → noisy and confusing

#+attr_latex: :width .6\linewidth
[[./img/histogram-bucket-width.png]]

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Broken scales in bar charts: start mid-axis to amplify tiny differences
- Makes small performance gaps look dramatic
- Always check whether the scale starts at zero
