* Introduction to Experimental Design

Ninety-ninety rule of project schedules:

#+begin_center
The first 90% of the task takes 10% of the time,

the last 10% takes the other 90%
#+end_center

_Goal_ \to maximize **information** with minimum **experiments**

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Benefits:
- Saves effort and cost
- Separates effects of different factors
- Determines significance vs random variation

#+latex: \pause\vfill

- Many possible designs → some more widely used
  - But before, some terminology

* Terminology: Response variable

#+begin_center
The outcome of an experiment
#+end_center

#+latex: \vfill

Usually system performance
- Throughput (tasks per time)
- Response time

General term used: **Response** (not limited to performance)

* Terminology: factors and levels

*Factors* are the parameters affecting response
- Example: CPU type, memory size, disk drives, workload, user level

#+latex: \vfill

*Levels* are the values of a factor
- CPU: 68000, Z80, 8086
- Memory: 512 KB, 2 MB, 8 MB
- Workload: secretarial, managerial, scientific
- Synonym: *Treatments*

* Primary and secondary factors

*Primary factors*
- Effects we want to quantify
- Example: CPU, memory, disk drives

#+latex: \vfill\pause

*Secondary factors*
- Affect performance, but not studied in detail
- Example: user education level, workload type

* Replication

#+begin_center
The repetition of experiments
#+end_center

#+latex: \vfill

Example:
- Repeat each experiment 3 times → study has 3 replications

Helps in reducing random variation

* Experimental Design

#+begin_center
The plan of experiments

(precisely, which experiments)
#+end_center

#+latex: \vfill

Usually has
- # of experiments
- Factor-level combinations
- Replications
  
Example: workstation study
- 3×3×4×3×3 = 324 experiments
- 5 replications → 1620 observations

* Interaction

Effect of one factor depends on level of the other factor (Interaction!)

Example
- Two factors A and B, each one with two levels (A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2)
