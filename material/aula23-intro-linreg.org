* Simple Linear Regression Models

Regression models are among the most common statistical models used by
analysts \to They allow estimation or prediction of a random variable as
a function of other variables

#+latex: \vfill\pause

- **Response variable**: the variable to be predicted
- **Predictor variables** (or factors): the variables used for prediction

#+latex: \vfill\pause

All predictors are assumed to be **quantitative**
- arithmetic operations are meaningful

- Understand concepts such as:
  - Confidence intervals for model parameters
  - Goodness of fit
- These concepts are essential for
  - Analysis of experimental designs

* Linear Regression Models

Regression can be used for **linear** and **nonlinear** models
- The most common application is finding the **best linear model**

#+latex: \vfill\pause

Such models are called **linear regression models**

When there is only **one predictor variable**
- the model is called a **simple linear regression model**

** Definition of a Good Model                                      :B_block:

- The first question: *What is a good model?*
- Consider data points and a straight-line model:
  - Some lines fit the data well
  - Others do not
- A good model has its line **close to most of the data points**

* Summary of this short introduction

- Regression models predict a response variable based on predictors
- Simple linear regression: one predictor variable

#+latex: \vfill\pause

- A good model minimizes vertical errors between predictions and data
- The **least-squares method** defines the “best” model mathematically
