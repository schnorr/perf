* 2^k Factorial Designs

- Often factor effects are monotonic
  - Performance increases or decreases as a factor moves from min to max
  - Example: performance improves when more memory is avaivable

- Full factorial designs may be too costly when many factors exist
  - 1st step: reduce the number of factors by testing only those likely to matter

- A 2^k design examines k factors, each with two levels
  - Useful early in performance studies with many candidate factors
  - Goal: identify which factors have the strongest impact

* 2² Designs: Starting with k = 2

To introduce 2^k designs, begin with the simplest case
- two factors, each at two levels
- Easy to analyze and illustrates factor effects and interactions
  
Example:
- Memory size (factor A) and
- Cache size (factor B) for a workstation

* Example: Memory (A) and Cache (B)

Two levels for memory: 4 MB and 16 MB (xA)

Two levels for cache: 1 KB and 75 KB (xB)

  | Memory (xA) | Cache (xB) |  y |
  |-------------+------------+----|
  | 4 MB        | 1 KB       | 15 |
  | 16 MB       | 1 KB       | 45 |
  | 4 MB        | 75 KB      | 25 |
  | 16 MB       | 75 KB      | 75 |

Define coded variables: xA = ±1, xB = ±1

Regression model: y = q0 + qA xA + qB xB + qAB xA xB

* Example: Solving the 2^2 Regression

Regression model: y = q0 + qA xA + qB xB + qAB xA xB

Solving the 2² Regression
- Substituting the four observations yields four linear equations

  #+begin_src C
15 = q0 – qA – qB + qAB
45 = q0 + qA – qB – qAB
25 = q0 – qA + qB + qAB
75 = q0 + qA + qB + qAB
  #+end_src

- Solving gives: =y = 40 + 20 xA + 10 xB + 5 xA xB=

- Interpretation:
  - Mean performance: 40 MIPS
  - Effect of memory (A): 20 MIPS
  - Effect of cache (B): 10 MIPS
  - Interaction A×B: 5 MIPS
